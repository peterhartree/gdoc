# gdoc

A token-efficient CLI for AI agents to read, write, and collaborate on Google Docs.

`gdoc` gives AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.) a simple command-line interface to Google Docs and Drive. Every command is designed to minimize token usage while providing the context agents need — change detection banners, conflict prevention, structured output modes, and inline comment annotations.

## Install

`gdoc` is installed via [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). If you don't have it:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

See the [uv installation docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for other options (Homebrew, pipx, Windows PowerShell).

Then install `gdoc`:

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/LucaDeLeo/gdoc.git
```

Or from a local clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LucaDeLeo/gdoc.git
cd gdoc
uv tool install .
```

## Updating

```bash
gdoc update
```

`gdoc` also keeps itself fresh: running bare `gdoc`, `gdoc --help`, or `gdoc -h` upgrades to the latest release before printing help, so agents inspecting the CLI surface always see current help text. This only applies to `uv tool` installs, checks at most once per hour, and silently skips on any failure (offline, install error). Set `GDOC_AUTO_UPDATE=0` to disable it.

Other commands never auto-update — they print a notice to stderr (at most once per day) when a newer version is available.

## Setup

1. Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable the **Google Drive API** and **Google Docs API**
3. Create **OAuth 2.0 credentials** (Desktop application type)
4. Download the credentials JSON and place it at `~/.config/gdoc/credentials.json`
5. Authenticate:

```bash
gdoc auth
```

This opens a browser for the OAuth flow. Use `--no-browser` for headless environments (prints a URL to visit manually).

For multiple Google accounts, authenticate each named account with
`--account`:

```bash
gdoc auth --account pete@example.com
gdoc auth --account work@example.com
```

The first named account you authenticate becomes the default for bare
`gdoc` commands. To change it later without reauthenticating:

```bash
gdoc auth --set-default pete@example.com
```

### Org-wide setup (shared OAuth client)

For company rollouts, an admin creates **one** Google Cloud project with an
**Internal** OAuth consent screen and a Desktop-app OAuth client, then
distributes that client file so users never touch the Cloud Console. Each
user authenticates with one command. `gdoc` accepts the client config from
any of these sources (first match wins):

1. `GDOC_CLIENT_ID` + `GDOC_CLIENT_SECRET` — env vars (set via MDM/dotfiles)
2. `GDOC_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS` — path to an OAuth client JSON file
3. `~/.config/gdoc/credentials.json` — the default location

To fetch the client file from an internal URL and authenticate in one step:

```bash
gdoc auth --setup-url https://internal.example.com/gdoc-credentials.json
```

If `GDOC_SETUP_URL` is set, plain `gdoc auth` fetches from it automatically
when no client config is present yet — so with env vars pre-set, onboarding
is just `uv tool install gdoc && gdoc auth`.

Pass `--domain company.com` (or set `GDOC_AUTH_DOMAIN`) to pre-filter the
Google account chooser to your Workspace domain so users don't accidentally
pick a personal account. This is a UI hint only — domain enforcement comes
from the Internal consent screen.

## Quick start

```bash
# List files in Drive root
gdoc ls

# Search for a document
gdoc find "quarterly report"

# Read a document as markdown
gdoc cat DOC_ID

# Read with byte limit (UTF-8-safe truncation)
gdoc cat --max-bytes 5000 DOC_ID

# Read a specific tab
gdoc cat --tab "Notes" DOC_ID

# Read all tabs
gdoc cat --all-tabs DOC_ID

# List tabs in a document
gdoc tabs DOC_ID

# Read with inline comment annotations
gdoc cat --comments DOC_ID

# Get document metadata
gdoc info DOC_ID

# Find and replace text (supports markdown formatting)
gdoc edit DOC_ID "old text" "**new bold text**"

# Overwrite a document from a local file
gdoc write DOC_ID draft.md

# Create a new blank document
gdoc new "Meeting Notes"

# Create a document from a local markdown file (with image support)
gdoc new "Report" --file report.md

# Duplicate a document
gdoc cp DOC_ID "Copy of Report"

# List images, charts, and drawings
gdoc images DOC_ID

# Download images to a local directory
gdoc images --download /tmp/imgs DOC_ID

# Export a rendered PDF/DOCX/HTML file
gdoc export DOC_ID --out report.pdf

# Insert an image into an existing doc
gdoc insert-image DOC_ID diagram.png --after "Architecture"

# Replace an image's content in place (IDs from `gdoc images`)
gdoc replace-image DOC_ID kix.abc123 diagram-v2.png

# Read a spreadsheet (markdown table; --plain for TSV)
gdoc cat SHEET_ID

# Read a specific worksheet / range
gdoc cat --tab "Data" --range B2:D10 SHEET_ID

# Write cell values to a spreadsheet
gdoc cells SHEET_ID B2 -v "Yes"
gdoc cells SHEET_ID A1 --file rows.csv
```

All commands accept a full Google Docs/Sheets URL or a bare document ID:

```bash
gdoc cat https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aBcDeFg.../edit
gdoc cat 1aBcDeFg...
```

### Writing

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `edit DOC OLD NEW` | Find and replace text with Markdown formatting, including text inside tables (`--all` for all; `--normalize` to match through smart quotes/dashes; `-` reads an argument from stdin) |
| `edit DOC --cell ADDR NEW` | Replace a table cell by label or `ROW,COL` coordinates (`--col`, `--table`) |
| `write DOC FILE` | Overwrite document from a local markdown file |

| `replace-image DOC ID IMG` | Swap an image's content in place, keeping its size (IDs from `gdoc images`) |
| `cp DOC TITLE` | Duplicate a document |

### Revisions & diffs

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `revisions DOC` | List retained revisions — id, modified time, author, `[keep]` marker (`--limit N`; alias: `history`) |
| `cat --revision REV DOC` | Export a past revision to stdout |
| `pull --revision REV DOC FILE` | Download a past revision (gets `source:`/`revision:` frontmatter, not `gdoc:`, so it can't be pushed back by accident) |
| `diff DOC FILE` | Compare the current doc against a local file (unified diff) |
| `diff DOC --rev A..B` | Word-diff two revisions (`--rev A` compares A against latest) |
| `diff DOC --since ISO` | What changed since a timestamp (last revision at/before it vs latest) |
| `diff DOC --rev A..B --format html` | Write a styled diff artifact (`--out PATH`, `--with-comments` to anchor comment threads) |

### Comments

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `comments DOC` | List all open comments (`--all` to include resolved) |
| `comment DOC TEXT` | Add a comment (`--quote` to anchor it to text — see below) |
| `comment-info DOC ID` | Get a single comment with full detail |
| `reply DOC COMMENT_ID TEXT` | Reply to a comment |
| `resolve DOC COMMENT_ID` | Resolve a comment (`--message` to include a note) |
| `reopen DOC COMMENT_ID` | Reopen a resolved comment |
| `delete-comment DOC ID` | Delete a comment (`--force` to skip confirmation) |

`comment --quote "some doc text"` anchors the comment to the first occurrence
of that text (all tabs are searched). When the OAuth client's Cloud project is
enrolled in the
[Google Workspace Developer Preview Program](https://developers.google.com/workspace/preview),
this creates a **real anchored comment** via the Docs API `insertComment`
request — highlighted in the Docs UI exactly like a comment made by hand
(`OK comment #ID (anchored)`; `"anchored": true` in `--json`). Without preview
access (or with comment-only permission on the doc, which can't `batchUpdate`),
or when the quoted text isn't found in the document, it falls back
transparently to the Drive API path: the comment is created unanchored
(`anchored: false` in `--json`/`--plain`) with the quote stored as
`quotedFileContent` metadata, which `cat --comments` matches client-side but
the Docs UI does not highlight. Same command either way — anchoring problems
never fail the comment (though unrelated API errors, like a missing doc or
expired auth, still do).

### Other

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `auth` | Authenticate with Google (`--no-browser` for headless) |
| `share DOC EMAIL` | Share a document (`--role reader\|writer\|commenter`) |
| `share DOC --domain D` / `--anyone` | Link-based sharing with a Workspace domain or anyone with the link (`--discoverable` to also surface in search) |
| `mkdir TITLE` | Create a Drive folder (`--parent FOLDER`) |
| `mv DOC FOLDER` | Move a file into a folder (alias: `move`) |
| `rename DOC TITLE` | Rename a file |
| `mcp` | Serve gdoc to desktop chat apps over MCP (`--read-only`, `--allow`) |
| `update` | Update gdoc to the latest release |

## Desktop chat apps (MCP)

`gdoc mcp` runs gdoc as a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
server on stdio, so clients that launch a local server — Claude Desktop,
the Codex CLI, and others — can use gdoc without shell access.
Each supported subcommand becomes a tool (`gdoc_cat`, `gdoc_edit`, …),
with its parameters derived from the CLI itself.

Authenticate first — the server cannot open a browser for the OAuth flow:

```bash
gdoc auth
```

**Claude Desktop** — add to `claude_desktop_config.json` (Settings →
Developer → Edit Config), then restart the app:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gdoc": {
      "command": "gdoc",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

If the app can't find `gdoc` on its PATH, use the absolute path from
`which gdoc`.

**Codex CLI** — add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.gdoc]
command = "gdoc"
args = ["mcp"]
```

ChatGPT desktop itself only connects to *remote* MCP servers over HTTPS,
so it cannot launch `gdoc mcp` directly.

Useful flags:

```bash
# Reading only — nothing that can modify a Doc or Drive is exposed
gdoc mcp --read-only

# Expose a specific subset
gdoc mcp --allow cat,find,comments,comment

# Default account for every tool call (an explicit `account`
# argument on a call still wins)
gdoc mcp --account work
```

If `GDOC_ALLOW_COMMANDS` is set in the environment the client launches
the server with, it restricts the tool surface too — and must include
`mcp` for the server to start at all.

How the tools differ from the CLI:

- `write`, `insert`, and `new` take markdown content as inline `text`
  instead of a local file path.
- Parameters that name local files (`edit --old-file/--new-file`,
  `diff FILE`/`--out`, `images --download`, …) are not exposed: a chat
  client cannot see the server's filesystem, and hiding them keeps a
  prompt-injected model from reading or writing files on the host.
- `auth`, `update`, `config`, `pull`, `push`, `export`, `insert-image`,
  and `replace-image` are not exposed: they need a browser, change the
  install, or only work on local paths.
- `diff` reporting "differences found" (exit code 1 in the CLI,
  diff-style) is a normal result, not an error.

## Output modes

Every command supports four output modes:

```bash
gdoc info DOC              # terse (default) — compact, human-readable
gdoc info --verbose DOC    # verbose — all fields, full timestamps
gdoc info --json DOC       # json — machine-readable, wrapped in {"ok": true, ...}
gdoc info --plain DOC      # plain — stable TSV, no decoration, suitable for piping
```

The `--json`, `--verbose`, and `--plain` flags are mutually exclusive and can go before or after the subcommand.

Plain mode produces tab-separated output with no headers or decoration. Action commands emit `key\tvalue` pairs; list commands emit one row per item with tab-separated fields.

## Awareness system

`gdoc` tracks per-document state to help agents stay aware of external changes. Before most commands, a **pre-flight check** runs automatically and prints a banner to stderr:

```
--- first interaction with this doc ---
 📄 "Project Spec" by alice@example.com, last edited 2026-02-07
 💬 3 open comments, 1 resolved
---
```

On subsequent interactions:

```
--- since last interaction (12 min ago) ---
 ✎ doc edited by bob@example.com (v4 → v6)
 💬 new comment #abc by carol@example.com: "Should we add error handling here?"
 ✓ comment #def resolved by alice@example.com
---
```

If nothing changed: `--- no changes ---`

### Conflict prevention

The `write` command blocks if the document was modified since your last read:

```bash
gdoc cat DOC               # establishes a read baseline
# ... someone else edits the doc ...
gdoc write DOC draft.md    # ERR: doc changed since last read
gdoc cat DOC               # re-read to update baseline
gdoc write DOC draft.md    # OK written
```

Use `--force` to skip conflict detection. Use `--quiet` to skip pre-flight checks entirely (saves 2 API calls).

## Spreadsheets

`cat`, `tabs`, and `info` detect Google Sheets automatically — point them at a
spreadsheet URL and they read cell values instead of exporting markdown.
`cat` prints a markdown table by default, TSV with `--plain`, and raw rows
with `--json`; `--tab` selects a worksheet by title or numeric sheet id
(the `gid` in the URL), and `--range` limits output to an A1 range.
Reading defaults to the first worksheet — a stderr hint tells you when more
tabs exist.

Writes go through `gdoc cells`:

```bash
# One row of values, starting at B2
gdoc cells SHEET_ID B2:C2 -v "Y" -v "quote here"

# Bulk rows from a CSV (or TSV) file
gdoc cells SHEET_ID A2 --file rows.csv

# Pipe TSV from another tool
grep done report.tsv | gdoc cells SHEET_ID A2 --stdin

# Append below the existing table; parse values like the UI would
gdoc cells SHEET_ID A1 --append --user-entered -v "=SUM(B:B)"
```

Values are written literally by default (`RAW`); use `--user-entered` for
formulas, dates, and number parsing. The existing OAuth scope already covers
the Sheets API, so no re-authentication is needed.

## Annotated view

`cat --comments` produces line-numbered output with comments placed inline next to the text they reference:

```
     1	# Project Spec
     2
     3	The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users.
      	  [#abc open] alice@example.com on "up to 1000 concurrent users":
      	    "Is this enough? We had 1500 at peak last month."
      	    > bob@example.com: "Good point, let's bump to 2000."
     4
     5	Authentication uses OAuth2.
```

Comments whose anchor text has been deleted, is too short, or is ambiguous are grouped in an `[UNANCHORED]` section at the end.

## Revision history & diffs

Google Docs' "Version history" UI has no public API, but the Drive API exposes **milestone revisions** for native Docs, and each one is exportable. Two caveats baked into the tooling: revision ids are **sparse** (1, 3, 7, 20, …), and non-pinned revisions are **pruned by Google over time** — so `gdoc revisions` is the starting point, and a pruned revision produces a clear error pointing back to it.

```bash
# List retained revisions (oldest first; [keep] = pinned forever)
gdoc revisions DOC_ID

# What changed in the most recent edit?
gdoc diff DOC_ID --rev prev

# What changed since I last read it?
gdoc diff DOC_ID --since 2026-06-10T19:00:00Z

# Compare two specific revisions, chunkier word-diff
gdoc diff DOC_ID --rev 69..190 --min-common 30

# Styled artifact with the doc's comment threads anchored inline
gdoc diff DOC_ID --rev 69..190 --format html --with-comments --out review.html

# Read or download a past revision
gdoc cat DOC_ID --revision head~2
gdoc pull DOC_ID old-draft.md --revision @2026-06-01
```

**REV selectors** (shared by `cat`, `pull`, and `diff`): a bare revision id (`190`), `latest`/`head`, `prev`, `head~N` (N back from latest by list position), or `@ISO` (last revision at/before the timestamp; naive timestamps are local time).

Revision diffs print a colored word-diff to a TTY (plain text when piped; `--format` overrides). Rewritten sentences render as one contiguous removed/added chunk rather than word salad — shared scraps shorter than `--min-common` characters (default 24) are absorbed into the change. `--context N` controls how many unchanged blocks are kept around each change; the rest collapse to `⋯ N unchanged ⋯` (headings always stay). `--json` emits the documented diff model (`doc`/`old`/`new`/`hunks`, each hunk a list of `equal|del|ins` runs, plus `comments` with their anchored hunk index when `--with-comments` is set) wrapped with top-level `ok` and `identical` keys; combined with `--format html` it instead prints a JSON write confirmation (`path`, `format`, `changed`, `identical`). Exit code follows `diff DOC FILE`: 1 when the revisions differ, 0 when identical.

The diff model is display-oriented, not a faithful character diff: export escaping and whitespace are normalized, images become `⟦diagram⟧` placeholders, ordered-list renumbering alone doesn't register as a change, and coalescing relabels short unchanged spans as part of the surrounding change (pass `--min-common 0` for the uncoalesced word diff). The engine also parses Google's current markdown-export conventions (one line per paragraph, `![][imageN]` references) — like revision pruning, this is undocumented Google behavior that may change.

HTML output has no extra dependencies. Richer artifacts (docx, PDF, …) are deliberately not built in: `--json` emits the full diff model (including comment anchoring and list markers), and an external script or the calling agent renders it however it likes.

## Tabs

Google Docs supports multiple tabs per document. The default `cat` command uses Drive export which only returns the first tab. Use `--tab` or `--all-tabs` to read tab content via the Docs API:

```bash
# List tabs in a document
gdoc tabs DOC
# t.0	Tab 1
# t.abc	Notes

# Read a specific tab by title (case-insensitive) or ID
gdoc cat --tab "Notes" DOC

# Read all tabs with headers
gdoc cat --all-tabs DOC
# === Tab: Tab 1 ===
# ...content...
# === Tab: Notes ===
# ...content...
```

`--tab` and `--all-tabs` are mutually exclusive with `--comments`. They work with `--json` and `--plain`.

## Byte truncation

Use `--max-bytes` on `cat` to limit output size. Truncation is UTF-8-safe (never splits a multi-byte character):

```bash
gdoc cat --max-bytes 5000 DOC   # first ~5KB of content
```

Works with all `cat` modes: default, `--tab`, `--all-tabs`, `--comments`. In `--json` mode, truncation applies to the content field, not the JSON envelope.

## Native table insertion

`edit` supports markdown tables in replacement text. Tables are inserted as native Google Docs tables:

```bash
gdoc edit DOC "placeholder" "| Name | Score |
|------|-------|
| Alice | 95 |
| Bob | 87 |"
```

Tables require a single match — use without `--all` when the replacement contains a table.

## Editing inside tables

`edit` searches and replaces text inside table cells, not just plain paragraphs. For label/value grids (a label in one column, the value in the next), address a cell directly instead of anchoring on its current text:

```bash
# Replace the cell to the right of a label
gdoc edit DOC --tab "Tab 1" --cell "Discussion topics from JP" "Show and tell; Q2 planning"

# Address by ROW,COL coordinates (0-based) within the Nth table (--table, default 0)
gdoc edit DOC --cell 7,1 "new value"

# --col overrides which column to write (default: the one right of the label)
gdoc edit DOC --cell "Status" --col 2 "Done"
```

Cell edits preserve the cell's paragraph structure; an empty cell is filled in place. The replacement supports the same Markdown formatting as a normal `edit`.

### Matching tolerance

By default matching is exact. If an anchor isn't found, `edit` explains why — most often a smart-quote apostrophe (`’` vs `'`) or a line break where the anchor had a space. Pass `--normalize` to match through smart-quote and dash differences:

```bash
gdoc edit DOC "JP's job" "JP's role" --normalize   # matches "JP's job" in the doc
```

### Multi-line arguments from stdin

Pass `-` for the old or new argument to read it from stdin (one stream, so at most one `-`):

```bash
printf 'line one\nline two' | gdoc edit DOC --cell "Notes" -
```

## Import from file

Create a document from a local markdown file with `new --file`:

```bash
gdoc new "Report" --file report.md
```

Images in the markdown are handled automatically:
- **Remote images** (`https://...`) are inserted directly via URL
- **Local images** are uploaded to Drive temporarily, inserted, then cleaned up
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP

## Image inspection

List and download images, charts, and drawings embedded in a document:

```bash
# List all images with metadata
gdoc images DOC
# kix.abc  image  "Company Logo"  200x100pt
# kix.def  chart  "Q1 Revenue"    400x300pt
# kix.ghi  drawing  (not exportable)  150x150pt

# Download images to a local directory
gdoc images --download /tmp/imgs DOC
# /tmp/imgs/kix.abc.png
# /tmp/imgs/kix.def.png
# WARN: kix.ghi is a drawing (cannot export)

# Download a specific image by object ID
gdoc images --download /tmp/imgs DOC kix.abc
```

Drawings cannot be exported (the Google API exposes no content for them). Charts are rendered as images via their content URI. Downloaded files can be viewed directly by multimodal AI agents.

## Image editing

Add an image to an existing document, or swap one's content in place:

```bash
# Insert after anchor text (two matches = error; use a longer anchor)
gdoc insert-image DOC diagram.png --after "Architecture"

# Append at the end of a tab, with an explicit display size
gdoc insert-image DOC https://example.org/chart.png --tab Notes --end --width 400

# Replace an image's content, keeping its current size (center-cropped)
gdoc replace-image DOC kix.abc123 diagram-v2.png
```

Multi-tab documents require `--tab` so the insert can't land in the wrong
tab. Local files must be PNG, JPG, or GIF — the Docs API rejects WebP, so
gdoc refuses it up front (markdown import via `new --file` still accepts
WebP). Local files are uploaded to Drive as a temporary public-read file
(Google's servers fetch the image by URL), then deleted immediately after
the insert — if that cleanup ever fails, gdoc warns with the file ID
instead of leaving the exposure silent.
## Native structure

`cat` is a prose view; `structure` is the editing model. It dumps the raw
Docs API document JSON so an agent can derive exact native mutation
targets — paragraph styles, table geometry, tab topology, inline objects,
named ranges, and the UTF-16 `startIndex`/`endIndex` values every
`batchUpdate` range needs:

```bash
# Whole document (compact JSON; --verbose to indent)
gdoc structure DOC

# One tab's subtree, plus documentId/revisionId
gdoc structure DOC --tab Notes

# Trim the payload with a raw field mask
gdoc structure DOC --fields 'revisionId,tabs(tabProperties)'

# Render suggestions as accepted/rejected before reading indexes
gdoc structure DOC --suggestions-view-mode preview_suggestions_accepted
```

Two index caveats: Docs indices count UTF-16 code units (an emoji is two
units, a smart chip is one), and the suggestions view mode changes both
content and indexes — the mode used is echoed in the output.

## Command allowlist

Restrict which subcommands are available using `--allow-commands` or the `GDOC_ALLOW_COMMANDS` environment variable. Useful for sandboxing AI agents to read-only operations:

```bash
# Only allow read commands
gdoc --allow-commands cat,ls,find,info,comments cat DOC

# Via environment variable
export GDOC_ALLOW_COMMANDS=cat,ls,find,info,comments
gdoc edit DOC "old" "new"  # ERR: command not allowed: edit
```

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | API or unexpected error |
| 2 | Authentication error (run `gdoc auth`) |
| 3 | Usage or validation error |

Exception: `gdoc diff` follows `diff(1)` semantics — exit 1 means the contents differ, 0 means identical.

Errors always print `ERR: <message>` to stderr, even in `--json` mode.

## Configuration

All files are stored under `~/.config/gdoc/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `credentials.json` | OAuth client credentials (from Google Cloud Console) |
| `token.json` | Legacy default OAuth token (created by older `gdoc auth` flows) |
| `accounts/<ACCOUNT>/token.json` | OAuth token for a named account |
| `config.json` | Default account preference and other local configuration |
| `state/<DOC_ID>.json` | Per-document state for change detection |
| `update_check.json` | Cached result of the last update check |
